# CS 174A Group Project: Cat Invaders
## Concept
Play as a space cat defending your planet against aliens with supersonic kibble in a *Space Invaders*-esque game. Shoot projectiles at waves of enemies to defeat them. Destroy all enemies to pass a level, or let them reach you and reach game over. Computer graphics concepts include object transformations, rendering, modeling, and lighting, as well as collision detection. 

## Controls
Use 'A' and 'D' to move your character left and right, respectively. Use 'S' to shoot kibble upwards. Use 'spacebar' to start, continue, and pause the game.
